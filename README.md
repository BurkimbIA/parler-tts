# Introduction

Toolskit-TTS is a comprehensive toolkit designed to facilitate research and development in Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems. It provides resources, scripts, and best practices for working with TTS datasets, training models, and evaluating results. The toolkit supports multilingual and multi-speaker scenarios, making it suitable for a wide range of TTS research projects.

# Our Datasets

Our current dataset consists of approximately 50 hours of audio sourced from Bible JW and Mooreburkina. These audio files have undergone preprocessing steps such as denoising and enhancement. For more details, visit:

# Working with Audio Datasets

Working with audio datasets for TTS involves several challenges, including alignment, diversity, and quality. For a detailed guide on audio preprocessing and dataset creation, refer to this blog:

# Transformers for Audio

Transformers have revolutionized the field of audio processing, enabling advanced capabilities in TTS. Key resources for understanding and implementing audio transformers include:

- [Audio Transformers Repository](https://github.com/anyantudre/Audio-Transformers-Hugging-Face/tree/main)
- [Hugging Face Audio Course](https://huggingface.co/learn/audio-course)

These resources provide a comprehensive overview of transformer architectures and their applications in audio tasks.
